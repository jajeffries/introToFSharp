\begin{slide}{What is F\#?}
\begin{itemize}
\item A functional language base that runs on the .NET framework
\begin{itemize}
\item can call existing .NET libraries
\item can make libraries to be called by other .NET code
\end{itemize}
\item Shares the core of the language with OCaml
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{What is functional programming and why use it?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data
\item Avoiding state makes it easier to test and reason about code
\item If there are no dependencies between functions they can be performed in parallel
\item It's generally more conicse - writing less code makes it harder to write in bugs
\end{itemize}
